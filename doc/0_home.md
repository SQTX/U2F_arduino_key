# Documentation for the U2F_Arduino_Key Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of the **U2F_arduino_key** project!
This document provides comprehensive information about the created circuit,
software, and the technologies and libraries used in it.

## Project Goals

The main goal of the U2F_Arduino_Key project was to create a highly functional circuit
that enables the generation of U2F tokens, meeting the requirements for login
(tokens align with those generated by dedicated applications).

The project itself was developed for educational and hobbyist purposes and **cannot serve
any additional form of protection for real-world applications.
It is solely a prototype created as a kind of curiosity.

### Key Features:

1. **Implementation of the U2F Standard**:\
   Tokens generated based on the obtained private key are always consistent with those obtained through
   other dedicated applications.

2. **Compatibility with Arduino Platform**:\
   The software is fully adapted to work with the Arduino UNO R3 board.

3. **Storing Keys in EEPROM Memory**:\
   The software allows for saving and retrieving imported private keys
   to the non-volatile EEPROM memory of the device. This way, keys are accessible even after a complete
   power disconnect in the circuit.

## Postscriptum
Thank you for your interest in my project.
Feel free to provide any comments, questions, or corrections regarding the code itself
as well as the entire project.
